# My Personal Project 
<h2><em>Recipe Manager Application</em></h2>

<p>I am going to describe the project that I propose to design in this semester. </p>
<p>I would like to work on the recipe manager application for two main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that I would like to help people use less paper to jot down the food recipe.
<p>The second reason is that I would like to help people to save money and advance their cooking skill.</p>
<p>This application will help people to learn different recipe from different parts of the world and 
enjoy different foods.</p> 
<p>You can find the answer to common questions related to my project below.</p>
 
<h3><strong><em>What will the application do? </em></strong></h3>


- <h5>This application will <strong>replace traditional cook book</strong> </h5>
- <h5>This application will help people to <strong>cook at home </strong> and save money</h5>

<h3><strong><em>Who will use it? </em></strong></h3>


- <h5>This application will help <strong>beginner</strong> to advance their cooking skill </h5>

<h3><strong><em>Why is this project of interest to you? </em></strong></h3>


- <h5>I would like to advance my programming skill. </h5>
- <h5>I would like to help people to advance their cooking skills. </h5>

<h3><strong><em>What are my user stories for phase 1 ? </em></strong></h3>


<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to add a  food recipe to my collection </p>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to select a food recipe in my collection and view the recipe in detail</p>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to select a food recipe and rate it </p>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to select a recipe in my collection and view the recipe in detail.</p>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to view a list of the titles of the food recipes in my collection</p>

<h3><strong><em>What are my user stories for phase two? </em></strong></h3>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to to save my food recipe to file.</p>
<p>As a user, <strong> I want to be able</strong> to load my food recipe from file </p>

<h3><strong><em>"Phase 4: Task 2" </em></strong></h3>
<p> I chose the second option- A type hierarchy- </p>
<p> ButtonTerm-ButtonExiting-ButtonShowReciping </p>


<h3><strong><em>"Phase 4: Task 3" </em></strong></h3>
<p>  Reflect on the design presented in your UML class diagram. </p>

<p> is there any refactoring that you would do to improve your design? </p>

<p> Yes, every program can be designed better based on programmer experience. </p>
<p> I will define more subclass based on abstract class for other buttons</p>
<p> I can use button term to create more button like load, save and details which helps less duplication in 
ButtonAddRecipe class and less coupling. This will help future programmer to work on the program more easily.</p>
<p> I will read other design books related to java to improve the design of my application</p>
<p> I will reduce duplication in ButtonAddRecipe by creating super class with the help of idea</p>
<p> For example, showInputFoodRecipe can be used to create a supercalss.</p>
<p> I will use ButtonTerm asbtract class to reduce duplication in ButtonAddRecipe Class to reduce duplication 
and coupling</p>
<p> I can create another superclass and different design using refactor and superclass in IDEA. For example, 
choose showButtonClick and foodlist field to create another superclass which helps less duplication.</p>

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
