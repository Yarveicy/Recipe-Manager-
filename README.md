# My Personal Project 
<h2><em>Recipe Manager Application</em></h2>

<p>I am going to describe the project that I propose to design in this semester. </p>
<p>I would like to work on the recipe manager application for two main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that I would like to help people use less paper to jot down the food recipe.
<p>The second reason is that I would like to help people to save money and advance their cooking skill.</p>
<p>This application will help people to learn different recipe from different parts of the world and 
enjoy different foods.</p> 
<p>You can find the answer to common questions related to my project below.</p>

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
