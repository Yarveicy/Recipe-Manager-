# Recipe Manager


This app contains several features for managing a list of food recipes. First and foremost, users can add or remove food recipes from their list and can see their new list. Users are also able to save their data to a file and later retrieve it from that file after the program has terminated and restarted. Users can rate food recipes for other users. The last feature is that users can find information about any given food such as the ingredients, required time to cook, a procedure to cook, and rating.
